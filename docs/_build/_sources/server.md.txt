# Server

Before using nbforms in a notebook, you must deploy a webapp to Heroku which will collect and organize the responses. If you plan to have multiple notebooks, you only need one server, as you can provide a notebook identifier in the config files that will distinguish responses.

To deploy the webapp, click the deploy button in the [nbforms-server README](https://github.com/chrispyles/nbforms-server).

## Managing the Server

<!-- rake tasks, etc. -->
